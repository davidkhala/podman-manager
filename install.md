# [On Windows](https://podman.io/docs/installation#windows)
- On Windows, each Podman machine is backed by a virtualized Windows System for Linux (WSLv2) distribution.
- Once installed, the podman command can be run directly from your Windows PowerShell (or CMD) prompt, where it remotely communicates with the podman service running in the WSL environment.
- Alternatively, you can access Podman directly from the WSL instance if you prefer a Linux prompt and Linux tooling.
